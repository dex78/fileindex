# File Index Cache

Lightning fast file change lookups with content integrity check. An inspiration of
GIT index.

## Motivation
 
Everyone works with files and we are depending heavily on their freshness. Which
file was changed? Are there any updates? Do I need to copy it? Services like Dropbox,
and Google Drive, Backup systems and Desktop search engines, thumbnail generations 
and build systems, etc. all need to know what is happening with the user's files. 

File change detection and integrity checks are fundamental requirements for 
almost every systems. Time to answer these questions can be crucial, too. E.g. is
the data still up-to-date after the time consuming backup procedure has finished?

File Index Cache helps answers these questions fast and correct. It builds a fast 
lookup index of a full directory structure. The change is detected by comparing
a persisted index with the current filesystem state. Filesystem informations like
modification timestamps or inodes on Unix systems help to get very good results.

Furthermore, the file content can be verified by there content hash. Checksums of
files and directories from the files leaves up to the root directory and a
cryptographic hash sum verifies that no single bit changed. The fingerprint of 
the root hash tree summarizes the state down to just a few bytes. 
For synchronization proposes the hash tree can cut-off huge common sub directories 
and only changed folders and files can be detected.

There are sooo many use cases for this file index...

## Usage

    $ mvn package
    $ java -jar target/fileindex-*-cli.jar [path]
    
The file index is read and written in the given path in the `.fileindex` file.

    $ java -jar target/fileindex-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-cli.jar 
    M  .git/logs/refs/heads/master
    C  .git/objects/17/b0bef62e9eedc172fd81ee818149a0a7206cef
    C  .git/objects/bf/079448c9afd088f5fab951934da55de9ac3cbb
    M  .git/refs/heads/master
    M  .idea/workspace.xml
    R  fileindex.log
    M  src/main/java/de/silef/service/file/FileIndexCli.java
    M  target/classes/de/silef/service/file/util/PathWalker.class
    M  target/classes/simplelogger.properties
    M  target/fileindex-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-cli.jar

Limit content integrity by `-M` option to save index creation time. Actually, it
can be resumed - never mind :-)

Following command will index the `/home/me/Documents` folder. Content hashes of 
files more than 10 MB are not calculated. 

    $ java -jar target/fileindex-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-cli.jar -M 10mb /home/me/Documents

For help use `-h` option:
 
    usage: fileindex <options> [path]

    Following options are available:
     -h                           Print this help
     -i <arg>                     Index file to store. Default is
                                  ~/.cache/fileindex/<dirname>.index
     -M,--verify-max-size <arg>   Limit content integrity verification by file
                                  size. Use 0 to disable
     -n                           Print changes only. Requires an existing
                                  file index
        --output-limit <arg>      Limit change output printing. Default is 256
     -q                           Quiet mode
